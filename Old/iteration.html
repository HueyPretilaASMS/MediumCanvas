		<h2>Design of Program</h2>
		<p>For the design, we collated ideas from already existing interfaces Krita and Paint Tool Sai. We wanted to emulate the best parts of these programs. We wanted our layout to be  minimal and efficient-diminishing confusion from the user of the placement of tools. We kept the top task bars similar to Krita, having the same order. On the right side there is a section that says what people are there similar to that of Google Doc. We decided for the options bar below the top one would only include opacity, size, switching colors option, and drop down menu for the tools for those who do not like the tool bar. We decided for small number of options to keep it minimal and not cluttered. We made the the options for brushes and pens on the right tool bar with the color. This will make it bigger and prevent having to go to the second top bar, saving time when adjusting color and changing tool. We also made the layers in a separate tab from the color wheel to leave room for the brushes. This decision would prevent the layers to be squished and allow elements within the layer to be seen easier beacuse of its bigger size. So that the color weel and layers could be seen at the same time, we will also add the option for the layer tab to be placed in either left or right side. The color wheel and layers tab being side by side will not be a default layout as it is in Paint Tool Sai because it will hinder the size of the canvas. Once this area of the program is finished, we will have people trial the program for efficiency and accesibility. A specific question we may ask if the layers tab should defautl</p>
