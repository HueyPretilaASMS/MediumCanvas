		<h2>What's the problem you're trying to solve?</h2>
		<p>The problem we are trying to solve is lack of collaboration in art, businesses not displaying consistent styles throughout their promotion quick enough, and lack of feedback due inconveincies in time.</p>
		<h2> Process in Framing Our Design Challenge </h2>
		<h3>1. Frame it as a design question.</h3>
		<p>How might collaboration in art be facilitated?</p>
		<h3>2. State the ultimate impact you're trying to have.</h3>
		<p>The impact of our product is allowing every artist and business to more efficiently and quickly combine artists styles to create a more unique artwork.</p>
		<h3>3.What are some possible solutions to your problem?</h3>
		<p>Our main solution is a program that allows for real-time editing with multiple people.</p>
		<h3>4. Finally, write down some of the context and constraints that you're facing.</h3>
		<p>A major constraint is that we don't have the resources such as a server computer and network that will enable us to host an efficient server. The program will also focus on digital painting tools and will not apply for traditional medium. We want to have it ready to put up the program along with the website on the internet as soon as possible.</p>
		<h3>5.Does your original question need a tweak? Try it again.</h3>
		<p>How might collaboration in digital art be facilated with artists and businesses?</p>
