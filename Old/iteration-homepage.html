		<h5>Figure 3. Prominent user interface link (within the red circle)</h5>
		<p class="reflection">For the homepage, I wanted display the artwork and opportunites to work with famous artists in a relatively large sliding display. For the iteration, I decided the width of it to take up 80% of the page in the middle. It looks a bit trunkated currently (because it has been zoomed out) so I have to figure out how the proportions could be kept even with zooming out. Along with this, my initial sketch design had three picture links directing the audience to different sections of the website below this big display. I changed the name of the "Platform" to "Exhibit and Tips" since it was clearer to the purpose of the section and it sounded nicer. I combined the tutorials and exhibit together to leave a different section for the Free Trial. I left out the user-interface link and replaced it with the "Plans" link because I decided to follow GoogleDrive by having a totally separate url (drive.google.com) instead of the official homepage as the main way customers access the user interface. Although in the official homepage of Google Drive the link to the user interface is very prominent as shown in figure 3, this method would likely take up an option from the big display or picture links, detracting from the other options they provide. Instead of having a prominent user interface link, I'll have the customer be directed to the user interface via the homepage through the "Log on" button on the top navigation bar since they already have to log on any way. Assessing the first iteration now at its completion, I realised I need to make a few changes including:</p>
		<p>-making the free trial more prominent by adding it above the big display box as a pop up that could be closed using an "x" on the top corner</p>
		<p>-making the main naviagation bar on top in fixed position (meaning it will remain visible even after scrolling down) so that the links can be accessed anywhere</p>
		<p>-Making it obvious that the pictures include links by adding a note that says "click the picture above to access this option"</p>
		<p>- And, the most obvious one, changing the pineapple proxy pictures into something more relavent</p>
		<p>I also think I will replace the Free Trial with a tutorial link or getting started link like I initially planed. </p>
