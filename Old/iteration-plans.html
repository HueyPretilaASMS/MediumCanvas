		<h5>Figure 1. Adobe Photoshop layout</h5>
		<p>Currently (as of 18/05/2018), the plans page looks like Figure 2 with the business and freelance artists plans on top of each other. I realised however that this layout would be inconveinent for the plan on the buttom since it would be less accessible requiring consumers to scroll down. I decided I would emulate a layout similar to AdobePhotoshop product page that makes different target audiences and features for each plan easier. Through finding inspiration from other layouts, I realised that currently our program can extend its markets to students, teachers, schools, and universities for group projects and feedback by teachers. I assumed that our features will not warrant four plans for each target market and one plan will be enough. However, assessing the photoshop, the potential features we may offer (such as different layout for the user interface depending on the style, collaboration with famous artists, etc.) could have expanded plans for storage, specialised tools, available layouts provided, customisation in layout, and opportunities to collaborate with famous artists. I was able to develop the plans more through drawing inspiration from other programs. </p>
