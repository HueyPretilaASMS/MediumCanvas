		<h1>Describe Your Idea</h1>
		<h2>From page 30 of this website <a href="https://education.uky.edu/nxgla/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2016/11/Designers-workbook.pdf">https://education.uky.edu/nxgla/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2016/11/Designers-workbook.pdf</a></h2>
		<h2>Concept Idea Name</h2>
		<p>Medium Canvas</p>
		<h2>Sketch</h2>
		<img src="New/Images/win_logosp.png" width="400">
		<h2>How does it work?</h2>
		<p>*It will allow more than one person to work in the same project at the same time with real-time editing using servers. Basically like Google drive except with digital art.</p>
		<h2>What needs or opportunities does the concept address?</h2>
		<p>It allows for easier melding of different styles. For example, if one artist is good in drawing figures and another for landscapes, each artist can contribute their respective strengths without having to wait for the other artist to finish. It will also allow for more collaboration in art between people from different countries and areas. Art teachers could also use it to provide quicker feedback to students since the artwork will be in progress, and mistakes will not be buried under many layers. Finally, businesses could use it to check up on designs for promotion and ensure that it is consistent.</p>
		<h2>One Sentence Concept Description</h2>
		<p>MediumCanvas will allow for efficiency in collaboration of digital art through real-time editting.</p>
		<h2>Who does it involve, both in building and using it?</h2>
		<p>-For buiding it: Coding teachers to sharpen HTML skills for website building</p>
		<p>For using it: artists and businesses</p>
		<h2>What do you hope to learn more about through prototyping this idea?</h2>
		<p>-The estimate time for program to be viable to launch in the internet</p>
		<p>-How efficient the design of the interface (including the tool bars and the drawing) is </p>
